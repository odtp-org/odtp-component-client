## Acknowledgments and Funding
This work is part of the broader project **O**pen **D**igital **T**win **P**latform of the **S**wiss **M**obility **S**ystem (ODTP-SMS) funded by Swissuniversities CHORD grant Track B - Establish Projects. ODTP-SMS project is a joint endeavour by the Center for Sustainable Future Mobility - CSFM (ETH Zürich) and the Swiss Data Science Center - SDSC (EPFL and ETH Zürich). 
The Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC) develops domain-agnostic standards and containerized components to manage digital twins. This includes the creation of the Core Platform (both back-end and front-end), Service Component Integration Templates, Component Ontology, and the Component Zoo template. 
The Center for Sustainable Future Mobility (CSFM) develops mobility services and utilizes the components produced by SDSC to deploy a mobility digital twin platform. CSFM focuses on integrating mobility services and collecting available components in the mobility zoo, thereby applying the digital twin concept in the realm of mobility.
